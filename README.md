# Pokédex Project

This is a project made entirely by me, where I created a Pokédex using an existing API that supports Pokémon up to the 9th generation.

The project allows you to type the name of a Pokémon, and it will display:

- Pokémon image
- Name
- Type
- Weight
- Abilities

If the searched name is invalid or belongs to a generation above the 9th, the message "Pokémon is not found" will appear.

## Technologies Used

- HTML and CSS for the layout and page structure
- JavaScript to integrate with the API and insert the information into the HTML

## How to Use

You can clone this project using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kaua73-dev/pokedex.git
